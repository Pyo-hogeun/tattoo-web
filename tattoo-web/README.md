# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).

## Gallery account interactions

Gallery likes and bookmarks use the implemented customer-only interactions API through `src/services/interactionsApi.ts`. Every request uses the Customer JWT from `customer_auth_token`; back-office keys are never read. Gallery `key` is used as `targetId`, while DELETE uses the interaction object's server-issued `id`.

Supported endpoints:

```text
GET    /api/interactions
POST   /api/interactions
DELETE /api/interactions/:id
```

The interaction list response contains the current customer's state:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "68a1234567890abcdef1234",
      "customerId": "68a9876543210abcdef9876",
      "targetType": "gallery",
      "targetId": "gallery/example.png",
      "type": "like",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-17T10:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-08-17T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

Creation uses `type: "like"` or `type: "bookmark"` and always targets a gallery key:

```json
{
  "targetType": "gallery",
  "targetId": "gallery/example.png",
  "type": "like"
}
```

The backend identifies the Customer from the JWT, so the client never sends `customerId`. A `401` clears only `customer_auth_token` and `customer_auth_user`; a `403` reports the wrong token type without touching back-office storage. A missing DELETE target is removed from local state because it is already absent server-side.

The JWT issued by the customer signup/login endpoints must identify the Customer collection record expected by the interaction guard. In particular, the token `sub` (or the backend's documented customer-id claim), token audience/type, signing key, and lookup collection must match the interaction authentication middleware. Issuing a token that points to a back-office User ID and then looking it up in Customer produces `유효하지 않은 계정입니다.` even though signup succeeded. The web client sends the returned token unchanged as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and clears the local customer session when the backend reports an invalid account.

## Kakao customer signup and uploads

The public Customer flow is fully separate from the shop-partner back office. `/signup` starts either a `user-signup` or `user-login` OAuth flow, and `/auth/kakao/callback` validates both state and flow before calling `POST /api/auth/kakao/user/signup` or `POST /api/auth/kakao/user/login`. Signup requires HTTP `201`; login requires HTTP `200`. Both return `{ "token", "user": { "id", "nickname", "role": "user" } }`. The callback claims and removes its one-time OAuth state before exchanging the authorization code, preventing a refresh or remount from sending the code twice.

The Kakao app has the nickname consent item enabled, so the authorize request explicitly includes `scope=profile_nickname`. This scope and the Kakao Developers consent configuration must remain aligned; requesting it while the consent item is disabled causes Kakao error `KOE205`. The backend must read the granted nickname from the Kakao user-info response, persist it on Customer, and return it as `user.nickname` instead of replacing it with a static `사용자` value. If Kakao does not return a nickname, inspect the user-info response and the account's consent state before applying a fallback.

Customer credentials are stored only under `customer_auth_token` and `customer_auth_user`; the back-office keys `auth_token` and `auth_user` are never read or changed. App startup restores local state and verifies it with `GET /api/auth/user/me`; a `401` or `403` clears only the Customer session. Logout clears the local Customer JWT, while account deletion calls `DELETE /api/auth/user/me` and clears the session after success. The Kakao client secret, access-token exchange, profile lookup, and Customer lookup remain backend responsibilities.

### Diagnosing contradictory duplicate and not-found responses

If signup returns `409` while login with the same Kakao account returns `404`, deleting only the back-office User is not sufficient evidence that every identity record was removed. Check the backend for a Customer record (including soft-deleted or inactive records), a separate OAuth/provider identity collection, stale unique indexes, and whether signup and login use the same Kakao app/client ID and the same normalized provider user ID. Signup duplicate detection and login lookup must query the same Customer identity scope. A partner identity must not be accepted as a Customer session.

Error responses should include a stable machine-readable `code` and an `X-Request-Id` header. The callback displays those non-secret values with the HTTP status so the matching server log can be located without exposing the Kakao authorization code or JWT.

Required web configuration:

```env
VITE_KAKAO_CLIENT_ID=your_kakao_rest_api_key
VITE_KAKAO_USER_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/auth/kakao/callback
```

The redirect URI must exactly match the backend `KAKAO_REDIRECT_URI` and Kakao developer-console registration. The backend must also allow the web origin through `FRONTEND_ORIGIN_USER`. Authenticated customer uploads use `POST /api/gallery` with the customer bearer token and multipart fields `image`, `title`, and `description`.

## API proxy and CORS

The browser calls the same-origin `/api` path by default. During `vite` development and preview, `vite.config.ts` proxies that path to `VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET` without rewriting it. For example, a browser request to `/api/gallery` is forwarded to `http://localhost:4000/api/gallery`. This avoids browser CORS preflights during local development, keeps credentialed session requests on the web origin, and preserves the backend's `/api` route prefix.

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:4000
```

Production hosting must provide the equivalent reverse proxy (`/api/*` to the backend) because the Vite development proxy is not part of the production bundle. If production intentionally calls the backend origin directly instead, the backend must return an explicit `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` matching the web origin (not `*` when credentials are used), `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, and accept the required methods and headers. A successful backend response can still be blocked by the browser when these CORS headers are absent or invalid.
